#Material covered this week
This week I started reading Rosenthal and Strange. I also worked on replicating the EG metric for agglomeration. 

#What I learned
I gained several useful skills in R, like how to use the aggregate function to subtotal a variable by zip code (or other variable). I also learned to merge datasets, delete columns, replace NAs with 0s, and use the hhi package to find the Herfindahl index for a variable. 

#Barriers
A lot of Rosenthal and Strange was hard to understand. I will need help to understand it. 


#Plan for next week
In the next week, I plan to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{read Alonso}
  \item{work on my presentation for July 11}
  \item{troubleshoot my metric and fix it}
\end{itemize}
