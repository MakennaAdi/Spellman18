#Research Questions
What causes industry agglomeration?
#Method
The authors use two different metrics of coagglomeration to measure agglomeration in industry pairs. The two metrics are the discrete EG metric developed in their 1997 paper and an approximation of the continuous DO metric developed by Duranton and Overman (2005). The DO metric gives an observed coagglomeration density which is then compared to the underlying distribution of manufacturing activity.
