So managing my existing project in R Studio through this repo is still way beyond me after 6 hours of studying git. I've somehow complicated the master/origin/branches so that Git no longer knows how to set up my local repo. ANYWAY, the point is that this is probably best learned starting with simpler things like your applied regression datasets. Either you can upload them or send them to me and I'll upload (hopefully all are smaller than 100 MB or there will be trouble) and then let's try to write R script that uses them...Easy enough, right? What are the other goals you have for GitHub?
