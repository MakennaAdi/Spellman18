# Spellman18
Nonprofit agglomeration project

This repository contains the .Rmd files for the nonprofit agglomeration project started during Spellman summer research 2018. No output files are included--the notebooks contained should be able to generate all PDFs, JPGs, and Rdata files necessary. The only thing not yet included is the raw data files which may be too large for GitHub. This is a work in progress.
